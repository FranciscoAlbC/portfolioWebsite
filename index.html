            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
            <p>Greetings! My name is Francisco Alberca, and at 28 years old, I find myself embracing the world of programming with unbridled enthusiasm. It's been an exhilarating journey of 6 months since I took my first steps into the realm of coding. Each line of code I write, every challenge I tackle, only deepens my passion for this beautiful career path. The prospect of what lies ahead excites me tremendously, as I continue to learn and grow in the ever-evolving field of programming.</p>
